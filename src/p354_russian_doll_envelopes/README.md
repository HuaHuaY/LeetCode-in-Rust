# p354_russian_doll_envelopes

Make first dimension be ascending, and second dimension be descending, then the quesion is same as [300. Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://github.com/HuaHuaY/LeetCode-in-Rust/tree/main/src/p300_longest_increasing_subsequence).

The purpose of making second dimension be descending is to make sure not to choose two envelopes that have the same first dimension.

使第一维升序，第二维降序，则问题与[300. 最长递增子序列](https://github.com/HuaHuaY/LeetCode-in-Rust/tree/main/src/p300_longest_increasing_subsequence)相同。

使第二维降序的目的是确保不要选择具有相同第一维的两个信封。
